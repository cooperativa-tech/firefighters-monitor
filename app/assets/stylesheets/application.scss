 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.css,
 * which will include all the files listed below.
 *
 * Any CSS and SCSS file within this directory, lib/assets/stylesheets,
 * or any plugin's vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced
 * here using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll
 * appear at the bottom of the compiled file so the styles you add
 * here take precedence over styles defined in any other CSS/SCSS files
 * in this directory. Styles in this file should be added after the last
 * require_* statement. It is generally better to create a new file per
 * style scope.
